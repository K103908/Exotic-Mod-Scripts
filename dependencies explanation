Dependencies
You can add dependencies to your mod by simple adding other mods name in your mod.json:


dependencies: [
  other-mod-name
  not-a-mod
]
The name of dependencies are lower-cased and spaces are replaced with - hyphens, for example Other MOD NamE becomes other-mod-name.

To reference the other mods assets, you must prefix the asset with the other mods name:

other-mod-name-not-copper would reference not-copper in other-mod-name
other-mod-name-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in other-mod-name
not-a-mod-angry-dagger would reference angry-dagger in not-a-mod
